Pre-requisite for Infonet OCR application
1. Java 21
OS User with admin rights and folder with all required permissions

Installation Process

1) Unzip the file ocr-distribution.zip at a suitable location.
e.g. /usr/infonet

2) After extration we will find "ocr" folder inside "infonet" folder

It has 3 subfolders in it viz bin, conf, scripts

a) bin folder contains the deployable file

b) conf folder contains application.properties, log4j2.xml file, and infonet-cert.p12 (Customer can change this or neglect this)

c) scripts folder contains the files required to run the application

3) application.properties file contains section to enable / disable SSL on application level
It is kept disabled by default
If required use this section to enable it & configure a valid certificate. (Provided infonet-cert.p12 is a dummy certificate that needs to be changed to actual)

4) User log4j2.xml to configure log home and log level
by default log level is set to ERROR but it can be changed as per requirement.
Valid values are: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL & ALL

5) scripts folder mainly contains 2 type of files
set-env.bat / set-env.sh
This file is used to set JAVA_HOME value. Modify this file according to the OS to set the correct JAVA_HOME value

6) Running the application
Once above steps are done, we can run the application using files start-ocr.bat / start-ocr.sh according to the given OS.
e.g sh start-ocr.sh (Hit enter)

By default application will on port 7020

we can change this by sending the new port number as argument to the above command.
e.g sh start-ocr.sh 7722 (Hit enter) 
In this case port 7722 will be used by the application

start-ocr.sh/bat file is configured to allocation 4GB memory to the application.
This can be changed according to the need.

7) Verify application
http://localhost:7722/ocr/welcome
Accessing this URL in browser should return Hello World string in response
Check protocol and port before hitting url
